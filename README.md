This Kata is written using Visual Studio 2019 targeting .NET Core 2.2

[.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

To run the tests from the command line execute `dotnet test PencilDurabilityKataTests` from within the directory containing the .sln file.

To run the application from the command line execute `dotnet run --project ./PencilDurabilityKata/PencilDurabilityKata.csproj` from within the directory containg the .sln file.

The command line execution was tested on Windows 10 and MacOS Mojave

NOTE: There is currently no application level functionality. I plan to add a console window to allow you to virtually write with the pencil but as of right now I don't have any more time to add additional features to the Kata.
