This Kata is written using Visual Studio 2019 targeting .NET Core 2.2

[.NET Core 2.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

To run the tests from the command line execute `dotnet test PencilDurabilityKataTests` from within the directory containing the .sln file.

To run the application from the command line execute `dotnet run --project ./PencilDurabilityKata/PencilDurabilityKata.csproj` from within the directory containg the .sln file. 

NOTE: There is currently no application level functionality. I will be adding a end-user interface through the command prompt but right now I am focusing on just writing the tests and functionality of the Pencil and Paper.
